                <p class="card-text">
                    Here we meet <strong>Confucius (孔子 / Kongzi)</strong> not as a distant icon, but as a 
                    teacher working with students on the messy, patterned reality of everyday life. His followers 
                    later compiled the <strong>Analects (论语, Lúnyǔ)</strong> from brief, context-rich scenes so 
                    that readers would be placed in the same reflective position as his original disciples.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Confucius's core insight is that we are shaped by <strong>patterns</strong>—habits, 
                    family customs, and social conventions that feel like a “true self” but can trap us. 
                    This site invites you to experiment with Confucian practice by logging “as-if” rituals 
                    and reflections that help you notice, interrupt, and retrain those patterns over time.

                <h3 class="card-title">What Are Rituals in Confucian Practice?</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                    For Confucius, <strong>ritual (礼, lǐ)</strong> is not empty tradition. It is a 
                    deliberate, creative practice that opens an <em>“as-if” space</em> where people step 
                    out of their usual roles and responses. In this space, they can feel, act, and relate 
                    differently—training themselves for real-world transformation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breaking patterns:</strong> Rituals that deliberately disrupt fixed social 
                        hierarchies and habits (as in mourning practices where all mourners are treated alike).</li>
                    <li><strong>“As-if” spaces:</strong> Situations where you act as if someone absent is present, 
                        or as if roles are reversed, to work through grief, anger, or resentment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Everyday training:</strong> Greetings, table manners, or difficult conversations 
                        treated as experiments in seeing from another's perspective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modern analogues:</strong> Classroom norms, therapy sessions, and family routines 
                        can all function as Confucian rituals when they are used to reshape patterns rather than 
                        simply reinforce them.</li>

                    Our tracker organizes rituals around four key Confucian virtues. Each offers a lens for 
                    sensing patterns and experimenting with new responses:
